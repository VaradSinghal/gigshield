# GigKavach Backend — Team Structure Guide

## Module Ownership

This backend is split into **3 independent modules** so each team member can work without merge conflicts.

| `imd.py` | Person 2 (flood triggers) |
| `payments.py` | Person 2 (payouts) |
| `notifications.py` | Person 1 (decision alerts), Person 2 (claim alerts) |

### Root Files
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|

## Rules for Clean Collaboration

1. **Stay in your module folder.** Don't edit files in another person's module.
2. **Shared models** — if you need a new field on a shared model, discuss with the team first.
3. **Shared services** — import and use them, but coordinate before modifying.
4. **Each module registers its own router** in `main.py` — one line per module.
5. **Schemas stay local** — each module has its own `schemas.py` for request/response validation.
